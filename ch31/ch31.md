# Chapter 31 - CoreDNS In Kubernetes

Services can communicate between each other using their name -> it is a DNS record

In Kubernetes DNS is implemented with the CoreDNS pods:

- `kubectl get deploy -n kube-system` -> `coredns` deployment
- `kubectl get svc -n kube-system` -> `kube-dns` service that wraps the `coredns` deployment

If I exec in one of my pods:

- `cat /etc/resolv.conf` -> shows Kubernetes dns nameserver IP
- `cat /etc/hosts`

CoreDNS pods

- Mount on `/etc/coredns` the configMap `coredns` -> contains configurations for the coredns pod

> [!NOTE]
> CoreDNS works only if there is a networking addon installed (e.g. calico)
