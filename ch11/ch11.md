# Chapter 11 - Multi Container Pod

Init container -> runs before the app container

- as soon as it finishes, the app container is started

Sidecar/helper container -> runs all the time alongside the app container

Commands

- `kubectl logs pod/myapp`
- `kubectl logs pod/myapp -c myContainer` -> show logs from a container in a pod (can also be an init or a helper container)
- `kubectl exec -it myapp -c myInitContainer -- sh` -> exec in a specific container of a pod (also init and sidecar containers)
