# Chapter 17 - Health Probes

Probe -> something that is monitoring the system

3 types of probes:

- Liveness probe -> monitor the application when it is running
  - shows warnings
  - restarts the application if it fails
- Readiness probe -> ensures the app is ready before routing traffic to it
  - after, the liveness probe is applied
- Startup probe -> ensures the app is started
  - after this succeeds, the readiness probe is applied
  - for slow/legacy apps that take a lot of time to start

Each probe can perform one of 3 checks:

1. HTTP request
2. TCP request -> open a port, if success -> probe succeeds
3. shell command -> if returns a 0-value: success

In a probe we can also specify:

- successThreshold -> how many success are needed to consider the pod healthy
- failureThreshold -> how many fails are needed to consider it as unhealthy
