# Chapter 17 - Autoscaling

Scaling = deploying the workload in multiple nodes as demand/utilization increases

Scaling types:

1. Horizontal autoscaling -> scale out/in of:
   1. Workloads(pods) -> HPA
   2. Nodes -> Cluster Autoscaling
2. Vertical autoscaling -> scale up/down
   1. Workloads(pods) -> VPA
   2. Nodes -> Node Autoprovisioning (not available by default in kubernetes, depends on the cloud provider)

Event-based autoscaling: [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) (3rd party tool)

Cron/Schedule based autoscaling

## Horizontal pod autoscaling

Add more pod replicas to the deployment as load increases.

It is available by default on kubernetes, but requires metrics from the metrics server.

## Vertical pod autoscaling

If a pod is not that much used or not mission-critical, we can use vertical autoscaling.

Allows to automatically resize the pod as load increases/decreases:

- requires a restart -> the app must afford some downtime

Not available by default on Kubernetes.

Commands:

- `kubectl autoscale deploy MY_DEPLOYMENT --cpu-percent=50 --min=MIN_REPLICAS --max=MAX_REPLICAS` -> create an HPA for a certain deployment
