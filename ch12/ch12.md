# Chapter 12 - Daemonsets, Job and Cronjob

## Daemonsets

Creates the specified pod in each node -> 1 pod per node

- does not support creating multiple replicas of a pod per node

Use cases:

- kube-proxy
- calico, flannel, weave-net (networking)
- monitoring agents
- logging agents

E.g. 2 nodes + control plane -> the daemonSet will schedue 2 pods, 1 for each worker node

- the control plane has a "taint" and does not tolerate other workloads -> so the DaemonSet does not spawn a pod in it

Commands:

- `kubectl get ds` -> get all daemonsets

## Cronjob

- every minute: `* * * * *`
