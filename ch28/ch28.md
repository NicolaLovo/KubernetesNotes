# Chapter 28 - Docker Volumes

Image -> composed of read-only layers

When a container is created it creates a *container/writable layer*, by copying the read-only layers of the image

- ephemeral layer -> is lost when the container is deleted

Storage drivers

- write data on the container layer
- stores the layers of the image
- main storage drivers(depend on the OS): `overlay2`, `zfs`, `vfs`

Volume driver

- make data persistent between container stop/restart/delete
- common driver: `local` -> for local storage

Creating a volume: `docker volume create MYVOLUME`

- creates a volume using the *local* volume driver
- located in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/MYVOLUME/_data`

`docker run -v MYVOLUME:/app image:latest`

- create a container and mount the volume on /app

Another way to persist data is to use bind mounts: `--mount type=bind,source=/SOURCE,target=/TARGET`
