# Chapter 36 - Logging and monitoring

Kubernetes does not come with monitoring embedded, we need to install the Metrics-Server addon:

- it creates the daemonSet cAdvisor -> collects node/container runtime metrics + pod data in the node and sends it to kubelet which forwards them to the metrics server
- the metric server exposes such metrics with the Metrics API to the API server

`kubectl top` calls the api server which calls the metrics API
